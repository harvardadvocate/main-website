Most of the cups in the house are missing a piece.  
Not about handles, about completion.  
Water pooling in a stray’s footprint: bellybutton heat.  
Follow my proof. Faith is the only way to praxis.  
Need more hours in the day.  
Need more stretch of twilight.  
Need more oil for the stop-me-creaking.  
Need to know where the fronds land at the end of a dandelion wish.  
Yesterday I saw a pair of eyes larger than I’d ever seen.  
Today I inherit a million blankets.  
Hold me for as long as you are able: Until even those handholds go droop.  
Until even our front door receives a root canal.  
Until even the first song we danced to becomes the broth.  
Not a chain of superstition, a bouquet.
