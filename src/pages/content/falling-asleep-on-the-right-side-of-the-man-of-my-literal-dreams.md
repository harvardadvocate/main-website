smooth doorknob face - and chest full of time bombs - spot of ultimate explosion far  
but miraculously not - beyond my amateur reach - am i the shortbread - or the not shortbread  
of the binary - you made in your sleep - strange strange cookie - what does efficiency  
have to do with - your mouth like something - made to be plucked - if i could bake anything  
into this melting feeling - it would be air - one sure handful - of yeast //  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // this is the future - last saturday  
couldn’t portend - last tuesday stuck pins in - last nightmare broke into - less like day than  
matins - song - you sing in your waking - but sleeping you rupture - my only - i move toward your  
meteor shower - of language - like big mouths for bits - of popcorn - that old party trick  
my poor reflex - rejects - the saving grace of palms //  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // i like you unwaxed - i like you illegible - can’t  
see the bus - but hear it arriving - footsteps outside the door - heavy as fingers - children  
climbing a trunk - slim leaves yellow - your dark tangling hair - piles of autumn colors  
trembling - ready to burst - can you imagine - back against the grass - red and orange and red  
and yellow butterflies - god did that - folded secrets - out of air - darling? your ears - close  
enough to toss a new coin in - watch it go down  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around - around - around - did you ever do that - at the zoo?
