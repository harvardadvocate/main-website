And then just like that, with hardly anyone  
noticing, it became daily harder to remember when  
this sense of being at sea had begun – at sea, as in  
on a wave of doubt mixed with fear and yet no small  
amount, incongruously, of fevered anticipation, not joy  
itself but the belief, still – the half-belief – some joy  
might come. Maybe  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the beginning doesn’t matter anyway –  
whatever wasn’t the case once, it’s the case now, long  
days of jazz and drinks named after jazz, Give me a John  
Coltrane, someone saying; another, I’ll take one more  
round of these Take Fives…Not that there aren’t  
those who suspect the headiness of this new weather  
will soon enough dissipate, the holler-and-buzz  
surrounding it will follow suit. We’re alike in that way,  
you and I – comrades, if you will, in our shared  
suspicion, whether you know it yet or not, says  
the captain to the young man across the room,  
who of course can’t hear him because the captain has  
only said this to himself, not aloud yet. He looks at  
the young man,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who hasn’t yet seen the captain. It’s as if  
he’s trying not to look. Look at me, thinks the captain. And  
the young man’s head starts to turn toward him. Any  
moment he’ll see the captain for the first time. The way  
all histories begin, apparently. What destroys finding  
what will be destroyed, though which is which has yet to be  
determined. Almost lavender, the captain’s eyes are, in this light.
