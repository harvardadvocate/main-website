It’s become as ordinary now  
as seeing my face reflected  

in the bathroom mirror,  
or hovering over the porcelain  

toilet. I think, it’s been  
nine years since you’ve died.  

I’ve made an invisible list  
of what you’ve missed. You never  

met the man I’ve married. Or  
sipped that aromatic bougie drink  

at the restaurant with smoked  
meats, or pet my dog, or toured  

my new house. It’s unfair  
but sometimes I pretend you’d  

hate it all, judge him, dismiss  
the podunk town we live in,  

just to make myself feel better.  
Other days, your face appears  

behind mine laughing in the mirror,  
me sharing a sideways secret  

about my life that you never  
asked for while, outside, someone  

hammers away at the door.
