In my dream the dead have arrived  
as escorts. We travel  

past cold hills and wolves  
wild in a deadlocked field. A corporation  

of stars cracks overhead. I lean  
my hand where the hunting dogs  

chase the rabbit, and they tell me  
constellation means assembled  

for life. Then they lend me  
a shovel and dissolve into night.  

There is no other way back. I dig  
through snow until the cold metal strikes.
