      Stranger, uninvited, you 
come up to us on the sidewalk, 

my daughter’s hand in mine, you 
look at her & 

coo, *It goes so fast.* What, stranger, 
is this unnamed *it*—this day? 

her life? our 

happiness? Stranger, maybe you 
missed it, but just now 

my daughter & I hurled 

rocks into the emptiness
& we created more 

emptiness.
