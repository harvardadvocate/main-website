I am headless in morning, so ask me to dance.  

And it’s simple, I never relapse. I admit  
it was me who once broke all the stars. Yes, I wrote  
the last word. But I really don’t understand why  

Shania Twain had no last shred of self once I was done  

with her. All man I feel I have no bones. Like worms  
in labs, heads having been removed, who dare still move  
as lacking nothing. What we lack is little more  

than it all. As in Strasbourg, how hundreds did dance  

without rest. And the boiling still deep in the streets:  
find once-ice. Long past vendors of nicotine, bread,  
through the throng. And four-hundred more join. Do not look  

at how all bodies fall to earth and meet the God who moves  

them. Better become child again. Let limbs be shaken off.  
themselves and grab the un-denying. Shania  
(the Queen) knew just what she was doing over me.
