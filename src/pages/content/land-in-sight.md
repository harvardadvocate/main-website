If I had faults to speak of they would be  
That I’m bad at pretending to be working.  
Summer is meant to make you sweat and if  
Your skin isn’t sloppy enough you best pack  
Up, leave earth by latest May. I don’t think  
You would need to sweat in space because  
There’s no one there to tell you to. Here there  
Are pools on earth, mostly lakes, and some  
What oceans. Slacking off at work, I found  
Myself watching footage of the moon landing,  
With arrows showing wires pulling men across  
The so-called “moon.” Accidentally, my sound  
Was on. There are parts of the ocean so deep  
They make a noise like high, the highest thing—  
And my boss once told me her dad believed  
He picked up, from his radio, the distress calls  
Amelia Earhart sent before she died. So I’m wide  
With apology when she hears about the moon  
Landing, across the room, having happened ֥  
"Here on earth." I didn't want you to find out  
Like this, I tell her. Now there’s nowhere to go.
