The earth is dry and I live by wanting  

it is not a violent loneliness &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just  

defenseless &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the moor of my opened body  

all the places I felt your absence it &nbsp;&nbsp; was residue -  

the sap between &nbsp;&nbsp; trees except I have never been  

so raw, except with you &nbsp;&nbsp; the way the body moves  

when it is in love is so tender &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please just  

hold me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not so much  

the drowning &nbsp;&nbsp; as the attempt to rise  

they tell me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but I am always  

mistaking the wounded for the water &nbsp;&nbsp; and the  

earth is dry and I live by wanting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like  

cain’s wife and all the women without name   

it was residue &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the body moves when it  

is in love is so tender &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please  

carry me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not so much  

the drowning as the attempt to rise
