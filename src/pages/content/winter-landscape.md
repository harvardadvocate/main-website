*A woman is / turned into a lake she is  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secretly pleased.* Great blue herons  
are moving across the sky / and the body  

of this twisted oak its / arrowed branches / flung  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in every direction / is now  
leafless / so that its outstretched  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arms do not / run the risk / of breaking  
their own weight / *cold sweat poured down  

my imprisoned limbs wherever / I moved my foot  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pool gathered* / that this water could  
bruise me my voice / caught in bird-call I  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; want you to put me in the ground  
with my mouth open / and when we say earth  

we mean human  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth / foxes have no history  
transcripts / know not how their great grandparents  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; died / and who among us / records / the continual  

losses / it is lighter / to be fleshless / a beetle colony  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takes three months to eat / a white dog clean  
like a hymn / say / *I will be taken* / knowing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bones will remain.

<sup>1</sup>The first line of this poem is inspired by Jia Tolentino’s New Yorker Article “How a Woman Becomes a Lake.” The other italicized portions of this poem are taken from Ovid’s *Metamorphoses,* when the nymph Arethusa recounts how Ceres, the river god, tried to rape her and as she was fleeing from him, she turned into a lake.
