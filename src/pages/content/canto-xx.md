*—for Patrick Pethybridge*
<br>

, the no-tongue bell
, the urn-mouth against the earth
, dream in which I would not sing
, though many asked me to sing
, slept warm in the stable straw
, with my head on a lamb breathing
, a full-grown lamb
, the bell around the cow’s neck
, did not ring
, the bell was sleeping
, dreaming that it would not ring
, goat mouth asleep in the hay
, the dream of eating hay
