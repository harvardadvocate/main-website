It’s a Friday in New York  
and fifty years from ’69.  
Though since we’ve yet to meet  
or have, and are still looking,  
what we’ve said to each other  
in photos and films, bars  
and basements, returns  
with enough echo  
to remind us of ourselves.  
Those of us who resisted heroes  
and sentiment. Those of us  
who waited and found neither—  
not the promised liberation  
in marriage, or the salvation  
of laws. How some asked  
to carry America’s guns  
and did. How others knew  
equality was a rumor,  
elusive as freedom or sex.  
Do you think about dying  
every time you have sex?  
I still think about dying.  
I do think about death.  
Or a day in childhood when I saw  
the only place I could live  
was here. Inside.  
So whoever wanted me  
had to come through the body.  
Which has rarely been beautiful  
to me. Too soft and unconvincing.  
Too small. I hope the future  
is free of god and memory.  
I hope the future is  
all body, all blood.  
And since to be queer  
is a way to forgive life,  
I’ll take as long as I want  
finishing my cigarette on Seventh,  
walking up Christopher  
and thinking of everyone  
who’s yet to get here—  
somewhere in a bedroom maybe,  
young and bored across  
the country, not impressed  
by our parades or idols,  
all the sponsorship we bought.  
I’m late for a drink but wander,  
handsome and aimless,  
looking for a sign  
before nodding to the dead  
who always need a light.
