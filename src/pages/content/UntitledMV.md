Few understood the fire  
and no one warned those  
who walked toward it  
or the spectators that gathered  
on rooftops and balconies to watch  
the wind carry it in dull waves  
 
Every light becomes a celebration  
at night when time worn thin  
rips under the weight of measuring hands  
 
The beams and walls of houses  
now diminished outlines  
left open welcoming late guests  
 
Around the fire pit  
the air regains its shape  
and rests a heavy coat  
the relief when darkness gives you warmth  
and in its hold there is no need  
 
To be seen a shadow or a body
