I shall miss you. Drinking
grass like
that; a creature
drinks
from a stream
its time
& they feel
their own trickle
and warmth
and wonder
what’s that
to know

my own
hug some
how the
language
slipping
the moon
drink
twice
once in my throat
once in my throat
and once
in my eyes
it’s a new
year

How about it
is sleep better
than death
is day better
than night
is love better
than eternity
are dogs
better than
cats
is coffee
what is coffee
any groaning
machine
better than
any chirping
animal
is a child
better than a
building
is an unseeing
woman
better than not
is heat
better than
ice cold
day
bright day
better
than telling
the truth
is truth
the ugly
thing you
share
is sharing
beautiful
or hurtful
and cruel
does a pen
have words
in any
event
endless
are words
like bullets
tearing flesh
announcing
themselves
what do they
tell do hurtful
words tell
the end of something
the body al
ways cold
the day was
never new
life is a prison
how are you
drinking that
saying that
writing that
the puppets
groan
the heating
clanks
its OPEN
to you
a box or a vista
a plate of cheeeeese
