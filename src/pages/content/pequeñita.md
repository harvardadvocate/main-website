<pre>
i only ever promised to lay there
                                               brown babies
under the mosquito net
                                               kept squealing until i
quiet as a bird could sleeping with a god
                                               pulled up my socks for them
over her head all proud & puffed up but
                                               all the way to my knees
i made such a mess in the bed
                                               y volví a casa
had to get out of the muck
                                               without any boots or silver or romance
asquerosa
                                               untouched by anything but dirty asphalt
i’d guzzled the mango nectar
                                               i wanted for someone to douse me
in the fridge without permission
                                               in my island’s holiest water
unlocked the bolts of my need
                                               to make me grown
como un tamborito, piel abierto
                                               tell me a thing or two
tell me,
                                               about what it feels like to eat yourself up
if the bachatero doesn’t
                                               wailing in sing song &
roll the güiro down the alley
                                               as ripe as the sorrow
all night did he ask for enough
                                               underneath my pillow
forgiveness? if i walked out into the
                                               i put my hands to work &
street wearing my childsclothes would
                                               hid my girlcharms
someone write a song about me
                                               my stink of youth that
as if i were a woman? my stomach
                                               offends the god, chokes the bird,
went tiktikatik & i became a grand band;
                                               tucks me in, & i can tell you it sings
the men in their wifebeaters & the dogs &
                                               it sings my need like a fable, like a howl
