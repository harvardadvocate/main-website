The mirror’s clubfooted,  
not me. Afro’s gone Medusa again.  
 
Every coil’s its own Hydra.  
I’m adventuring with a comb.  
 
The sink’s full of myths...  
The myths are growing...  
 
Everyday I find myself  
smaller with effort,  
 
my life’s light  
with every person who  
 
spoke of me. Last night,  
Achebe tried again  
 
and I nearly heard him.  
Ngũgĩ refuses these tones, says,  
 
*this music has the worst sort  
of oceans beneath it.*  

Besides, his ears  
are busy with real myths…  
 
*Being alive must be nice,*  
says the sink-basin, filling  
 
further with myths…  
I say, *abandon narrative,*  
 
latch on to landlocked  
home— forget ships,  
 
take planes! land with  
passport on to place  
 
with shore— forget ships,  
take planes! land with  
 
passport back to place  
without shore— forget ships  
 
for a day sometime on  
winter break, during summer—  
 
our only seasons here.  
My body’s a clubfooted boat,  
 
not me. One time I went  
blonde, that’s a different  
 
prow. One time I went  
with suit-jacket, that’s a different  
 
sail. One time I go  
and touch the exact difference,  
 
pretty, sailing, she says, *I love you.*  
I say, *whose boat.*
